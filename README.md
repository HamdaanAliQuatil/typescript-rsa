> [!CAUTION]
> One should avoid implementing their own cryptographic algorithms due to concerns over Side Channel Attacks and Heartbleed vulnerabilities. This is a learning project for CSC604 and should not be used in production.

<!-- GOAL -->
## Goal
We will first implement the textbook RSA algorithm as mentioned in Introduction to Crytpography by Behrouz A. Forouzan. 
We will then look for ways to optimize it and patch some of the known vulnerabilities.
